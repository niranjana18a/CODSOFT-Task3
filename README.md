🧠 CODSOFT Task 3 — Image Caption Generator

This project is part of the CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship, and demonstrates an AI-powered system capable of generating natural-language captions for uploaded images.

Using a pre-trained BLIP transformer model, the application interprets the content of an image and generates a meaningful description — combining Computer Vision + Natural Language Processing.

🚀 Features

📤 Upload any image from your device

🤖 AI automatically generates a caption

🌐 Web interface powered by Flask

⚡ Pre-trained BLIP Transformer Model (HuggingFace)

🖼️ Clean and simple UI

🧠 Model Architecture
Component	Technology
Image Encoder	BLIP Vision Transformer
Text Decoder	Transformer Language Model
Framework	PyTorch
Deployment	Flask Web App

The model is loaded using HuggingFace transformers library.
